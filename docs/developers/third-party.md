## HD Wallet Path

The BIP-0044 Path for our HD Wallets is as follows:

## Public REST Endpoints

The REST endpoints for API interaction (for example block explorers, wallets etc.), served by [light-clients](../software/light-client-rpc.md) can be found in [swagger.yaml](https://github.com/unification-com/mainchain/blob/master/client/lcd/swagger-ui/swagger.yaml)

Live examples can be found at [https://rest.unification.io/swagger/](https://rest.unification.io/swagger/).

## Public Tendermint RPC Endpoints

The Tendermint RPC endpoints, served by full-nodes can be found at [http://rpc1.unification.io](http://rpc1.unification.io).

The RPC specification is the same as [Tendermint](https://docs.tendermint.com/master/rpc/).
